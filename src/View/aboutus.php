The U.S. car market is saturated with established automakers like Ford (F), Honda (HMC), and Chevrolet (GM). But one company stands out from the mix: electric car maker Tesla Motors (TSLA). Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk gained notoriety in 2012 when it released its flagship car, the Model S.1

Tesla’s release positioned it as one of the few successful independent automakers and a pioneer in the electric car market. Notably, it also proved to be a hit with auto buyers. The Model S, a sleek luxury sedan that starts at $89,490, is ranked best in class in every category for electric sedans.23 When the Model S premiered in 2013, Tesla made headlines when trade press gave it laurels. The electric plug-in car received a near-perfect score of 99 out of 100 from Consumer Reports, which also named it as “the best car ever tested.”4

By September 2014, the car hit all-time sales records in the U.S. with 2,500 sold in just one month, and in Q1 2015, sales reached a new high at 10,030 sold.56 It is now considered a staple within the electric car stratosphere. As of March 4, 2022, the company’s market capitalization was $909.6 billion.7
